<p>On the afternoon of January 26, I was at the Indiana men’s basketball game when a <strong>chorus</strong> of cellphones in the crowd pinged, alertinsg them to the news of Kobe Bryant’s death. I was <strong>astonished</strong> at how quickly fans’ attention switched from the game to <strong>utter shock</strong> and disbelief at the news of Bryant’s passing.</p>

(10 points)<br>On Wednesday afternoons Annie took the bus into town to shop in the market. For an hour or  she would walk up and down between the stalls looking at everything, buying here and there, and  a sharp lookout for the bargains that were sometimes to be had. And then, with all the things she needed  she would leave the market for the streets of the town to spend another hour  she liked best: looking in furniture shop windows.<br>One Wednesday she found a new shop full of the most delightful things, with a notice inviting anyone to walk in and look  without feeling they had to buy something. Annie hesitated for a moment before stepping through the doorway where, almost at once, she stopped  before a green armchair. There was a card on the chair which said: “This fine chair is yours  less than a pound a week,” and very small at the bottom, “Cash price eighty-nine pounds fifty.” A pound a week… , she could almost pay that out of her housekeeping money and never miss it! A voice at her shoulder made her . “Can I help you, Madam?” She looked round at the assistant who had come softly to her .<br>“Oh, well, no,” she said. “I was just looking.” “We’ve chairs of all kinds in the showroom. If you’ll just come up, you will find something to suit you.”<br>Annie, worried at the thought of being persuaded to buy something she didn’t need, left the shop hurriedly.</li>

For each question there are four answers. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the brackets on the left. (10 points)<h3 id="Text-1"><a href="#Text-1" class="headerlink" title="Text 1"></a>Text 1</h3>There are a great many careers in which the increasing emphasis is on specialization. You find these careers in engineering, in production, in statistical work, and in teaching. But there is an increasing demand for people who are able to take in great area at a glance, people who perhaps do not know too much about any one field. There is, in other words, a demand for people who are capable of seeing the forest rather than the trees, of making general judgments. We can call these people “generalists.” And these “generalists” are particularly needed for positions in administration, where it is their job to see that other people do the work, where they have to plan for other people, to organize other people’s work, to begin it and judge it.<br>The specialist understands one field; his concern is with technique and tools. He is a “trained” man; and his educational background is properly technical or professional. The generalist – and especially the administrator – deals with people; his concern is with leadership, with planning, and with direction giving. He is an “educated” man; and the humanities are his strongest foundation. Very rarely is a specialist capable of being an administrator. And very rarely is a good generalist also a good specialist in particular field. Any organization needs both kinds of people, though different organizations need them in different proportions. It is your task to find out, during your training period, into which of the two kinds of jobs you fit, and to plan your career accordingly.<br>Your first job may turn out to be the right job for you – but this is pure accident. Certainly you should not change jobs constantly or people will become suspicious of your ability to hold any job. At the same time you must not look upon the first job as the final job; it is primarily a training job, an opportunity to understand yourself and your fitness for being an employee.</li>
<li>There is an increasing demand for <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] all round people in their own fields<br>[B] people whose job is to organize other people’s work<br>[C] generalists whose educational background is either technical or professional（B）<br>[D] specialists whose chief concern is to provide administrative guidance to others</li>
<li>The specialist is <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] a man whose job is to train other people<br>[B] a man who has been trained in more than one fields<br>[C] a man who can see the forest rather than the trees（D）<br>[D] a man whose concern is mainly with technical or professional matters</li>
<li>The administrator is <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] a “trained” man who is more a specialist than a generalist<br>[B] a man who sees the trees as well as the forest<br>[C] a man who is very strong in the humanities（C）<br>[D] a man who is an “educated” specialist</li>
<li>During your training period, it is important <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] to try to be a generalist<br>[B] to choose a profitable job<br>[C] to find an organization which fits you（D）<br>[D] to decide whether you are fit to be a specialist or a generalist</li>
<li>A man’s first job <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] is never the right job for him<br>[B] should not be regarded as his final job<br>[C] should not be changed or people will become suspicious of his ability to hold any job（B）<br>[D] is primarily an opportunity to fit himself for his final job<h3 id="Text-2"><a href="#Text-2" class="headerlink" title="Text 2"></a>Text 2</h3>At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land mass with mountain ranges whose extent and elevation are still uncertain. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. Man has explored, on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs fundamentally from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world – the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.<br>The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. This cold air current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia – a region rich in forest and mining industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement.</li>
<li>The best title for this selection would be <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] Iceland<br>[B] Land of Opportunity<br>[C] The Unknown Continent（C）<br>[D] Utopia at Last</li>
<li>At the time this article was written, our knowledge of Antarctica was <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] very limited<br>[B] vast<br>[C] fairly rich（A）<br>[D] nonexistent</li>
<li>Antarctica is bordered by the <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] Pacific Ocean<br>[B] Indian Ocean<br>[C] Atlantic Ocean（D）<br>[D] All three</li>
<li>The Antarctic is made uninhabitable primarily by <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] cold air<br>[B] calm seas<br>[C] ice（A）<br>[D] lack of knowledge about the continent</li>
<li>According to this article <strong>____</strong>.<br>[A] 2,000 people live on the Antarctic Continent<br>[B] a million people live within 2,000 miles of the South Pole<br>[C] weather conditions within a 2,000 mile radius of the South Pole make settlements impractical（C）<br>[D] only a handful of natives inhabit Antarctica<br>Section IV    Structure and Vocabulary<br>Fill in the blanks with the words which best complete the sentences.

(20 points)<br>It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. (71) If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (72) If a student goes to university to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (73) Schools often have too restricting an atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. (74) Most students would, I believe, profit by a year of such exploration of different academic studies, especially those “all rounders” with no particular interest. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degrees, so that in later life, they do not look back and say, “I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn’t taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn’t have ended up as an interpreter, but it’s too late now. I couldn’t go back and begin all over again.”<br>(75) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one’s time at university. (76) This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning. (77) He is immediately accepted by the University of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (78) It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and more advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are not to have, on the one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world.<br>1986年考研英语真题答案<br>Section I: Structure and Vocabulary (15 points)</li>

<h3 id="什么是Vue-js"><a href="#什么是Vue-js" class="headerlink" title="什么是Vue.js"></a>什么是Vue.js</h3><ul>
<li><p>Vue.js 是目前最火的一个前端框架，React是最流行的一个前端框架（React除了开发网站，还可以开发手机App， Vue语法也是可以用于进行手机App开发的，需要借助于Weex）</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vue.js 是前端的<strong>主流框架之一</strong>，和Angular.js、React.js 一起，并成为前端三大主流框架！</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vue.js 是一套构建用户界面的框架，<strong>只关注视图层</strong>，它不仅易于上手，还便于与第三方库或既有项目整合。（Vue有配套的第三方类库，可以整合起来做大型项目的开发）</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>前端的主要工作？主要负责MVC中的V这一层；主要工作就是和界面打交道，来制作前端页面效果；</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="为什么要学习流行框架"><a href="#为什么要学习流行框架" class="headerlink" title="为什么要学习流行框架"></a>为什么要学习流行框架</h2><ul>
<li>企业为了提高开发效率：在企业中，时间就是效率，效率就是金钱；<ul>
<li>企业中，使用框架，能够提高开发的效率；</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>提高开发效率的发展历程：原生JS -&gt; Jquery之类的类库 -&gt; 前端模板引擎 -&gt; Angular.js / Vue.js（能够帮助我们减少不必要的DOM操作；提高渲染效率；双向数据绑定的概念【通过框架提供的指令，我们前端程序员只需要关心数据的业务逻辑，不再关心DOM是如何渲染的了】）</li>
<li>在Vue中，一个核心的概念，就是让用户不再操作DOM元素，解放了用户的双手，让程序员可以更多的时间去关注业务逻辑；</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>增强自己就业时候的竞争力<ul>
<li>人无我有，人有我优</li>
<li>你平时不忙的时候，都在干嘛？</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="框架和库的区别"><a href="#框架和库的区别" class="headerlink" title="框架和库的区别"></a>框架和库的区别</h2><ul>
<li><p>框架：是一套完整的解决方案；对项目的侵入性较大，项目如果需要更换框架，则需要重新架构整个项目。</p>
<ul>
<li>node 中的 express；</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>库（插件）：提供某一个小功能，对项目的侵入性较小，如果某个库无法完成某些需求，可以很容易切换到其它库实现需求。<ul>
<li><ol>
<li>从Jquery 切换到 Zepto</li>
</ol>

<li><p>MVC 是后端的分层开发概念；</p>
</li>
<li><p>MVVM是前端视图层的概念，主要关注于 视图层分离，也就是说：MVVM把前端的视图层，分为了 三部分 Model, View , VM ViewModel</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.2.0+ 的版本里，<strong>当在组件中使用</strong> v-for 时，key 现在是必须的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>当 Vue.js 用 v-for 正在更新已渲染过的元素列表时，它默认用 “<strong>就地复用</strong>” 策略。如果数据项的顺序被改变，Vue将<strong>不是移动 DOM 元素来匹配数据项的顺序</strong>， 而是<strong>简单复用此处每个元素</strong>，并且确保它在特定索引下显示已被渲染过的每个元素。</p>
<p>为了给 Vue 一个提示，<strong>以便它能跟踪每个节点的身份，从而重用和重新排序现有元素</strong>，你需要为每项提供一个唯一 key 属性。</p>

<p>一般来说，v-if 有更高的切换消耗而 v-show 有更高的初始渲染消耗。因此，如果需要频繁切换 v-show 较好，如果在运行时条件不大可能改变 v-if 较好。</p>
